## General Idea
The goal of insertion sort is to iterate through each element in the array 
and *insert* it in the correct place in the sorted part of the array.


## Key Qualities
In-Place? - Yes
Stable?   - Yes
Time Complexity = O(n^2)
    We are interating through the entire array, so the 
Space Complexity = O(1)
